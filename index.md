# Introduction

Commercial videointercom systems are found in front of most buildings, public or residential. While older models use analog systems to call and display video, these are gradually phased out, as cheaper digital systems take over market and use modern TCP/IP networking. 

One such device is the Hikvision DS-KV6113-WPE1 IP Video Intercom system, which aims to bring TCP/IP and video calling to affordable standards. As with most cheap devices, there has to be a corner-cut in costs somewhere, and this article will hopefully shed some light on the current state of security this particular model implements.
